# NGO & Recruitement/Job Board Website Design for US Client
This repo contains code files website design I built for a US client in New York, who I found on Upwork.

I built this website on WordPress as a custom design with PHP.

This client is of Nigerian descent and wanted to design a viable website for his NGO for kids and youths, called [TekSeries](https://tekseries.com/), in South East Nigeria. I took on the project and delivered on all milestones for the client.

Delivering on my milestones effectively, cordially, and before deadlines, helped advance my relationship this client. We still talk till date and I've met and been introduced to more clients because of this one project/job.

This was the client's review on [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/allwell):

> Allwell delivered and is truly rising to the top. His attention to the details of this task, responsiveness and great attitude, made this assignment seamless. I’m looking forward to our next project. Thank you again Allwell.

### TekSeries

TekSeries, a New York based N.G.O, was founded to contribute to preparing the next group of future-ready workers and innovators, amongst underserved segments of Nigeria’s teeming youth population.
